# Clonal evolution simulation

## Requirement
We used the open-source agent-based modeling platform called [HAL](https://halloworld.org/index.html) to run the simulation `A3MH2D.java`. One can download HAL and use the library to run simulation.

## Draw figures
One can use the R script `clonal_evolution_figures.R` to generate **Figure 4** in the manuscript.
